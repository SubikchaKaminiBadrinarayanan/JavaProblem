/*Use print statements to create your own beautiful original ASCII art. Use comments to describe what your image is depicting.
It’s ok for your art to rely on only a single character, besides space, such as X or #. But you’re encouraged to use a few different 
characters in your design, like in the cat example from class.
Your art must also:
• Use at least 8 print statements
• Be at least 8 characters wide
• Use at least 20 characters that aren’t space
You’re welcome to create another cat. However, this image must look significantly different from the example used in class. Similarly, 
you’re welcome to create another face, but it must look significantly different from the face in the previous practice (it’s way too easy to 
turn the smiley face into a frowny face).*/
